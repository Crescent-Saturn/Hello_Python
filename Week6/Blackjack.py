# remember to review the gradic rubric
# Grading rubric - 18 pts total (scaled to 100)

# 1 pt - The program opens a frame with the title "Blackjack" appearing on the canvas.
# 3 pts - The program displays 3 buttons ("Deal", "Hit" and "Stand") in the control area. (1 pt per button)
# 2 pts - The program graphically displays the player's hand using card sprites. 
#		(1 pt if text is displayed in the console instead) 
# 2 pts - The program graphically displays the dealer's hand using card sprites. 
#		Displaying both of the dealer's cards face up is allowable when evaluating this bullet. 
#		(1 pt if text displayed in the console instead)
# 1 pt - Hitting the "Deal" button deals out new hands to the player and dealer.
# 1 pt - Hitting the "Hit" button deals another card to the player. 
# 1 pt - Hitting the "Stand" button deals cards to the dealer as necessary.
# 1 pt - The program correctly recognizes the player busting. 
# 1 pt - The program correctly recognizes the dealer busting. 
# 1 pt - The program correctly computes hand values and declares a winner. 
#		Evalute based on player/dealer winner messages. 
# 1 pt - The dealer's hole card is hidden until the hand is over when it is then displayed.
# 2 pts - The program accurately prompts the player for an action with the messages 
#        "Hit or stand?" and "New deal?". (1 pt per message)
# 1 pt - The program keeps score correctly.
